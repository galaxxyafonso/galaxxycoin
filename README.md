##### WebMining by GalaxxyCoin

Don't have good pc specs? You can now **WebMine**

**How does it work**

We get our Galaxxyed PC Components, host on wix. But you see the website that we hosted on our server, and not at the wix server.

Then, we mine at our PC while you see the website that we hosted, by invisible ads.
